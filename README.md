# Blast Mojo - Javascript Web Framework 


## Why create another Framework?

Early 2007, Blast Mojo was born in order to:

* Provide a standard, consistent architecture for developing with JavaScript
* Work with different libraries without conflict
* Structure and organize JavaScript
* Enforce separation of concerns
* Ensure code can be shared and re-used


## Why use Blast Mojo?

* Blast Mojo offers a foundation that other libraries and developers can take advantage of. It was built to provide a consistent architectural structure for development of small to massive projects allowing for code reuse and flexibility

* Enforces organization and clean separation of code to ease readability and maintainability

* Includes Mojo StdLib library which consists of well-tested and reusable behaviors and components for rapid prototyping and development
 
* Increases productivity of large teams working in parallel, particularly on Agile projects, by dividing work into implementation silos and allowing incremental development

* Reduces developer ramp-up time starting on new projects because they are already accustomed to the coding structures, patterns and practices

* Development speeds up as times goes on compared to the opposite that happens when code becomes too tightly bound
